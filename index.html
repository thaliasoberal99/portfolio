    <p>Designing is my passion. I believe as a Ux/Ui designer it is my duty to understand people and solve their problems. 
      My goal is to make their life easier and better any way possible. By using my motivation, persistence, and skills I am 
      more than capable of always meeting this goal.</p>
      <p>I currently attend Kenzie Academy remotely as a Ui student. I just recieved my certificate for Ux designing on July 24. 
        I have work on a few designing projects and am locking to further along my both my experience and education.</p>
